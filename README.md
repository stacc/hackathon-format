# Stacc Innovation Lab

## Intro

This document will evolve as the format changes. It will describe how to run a _Innovation Lab_.

## Preamble

This event type is often known as a _hackathon_. A _hackathon_ is _not_ for _hackers_ only. It is just as much an event for product owners, test ppl, management and sales. The name does the event a disservice by setting an assumption of _hackers only_ Therefore this document will replace the name _hackathon_ with _Innovation Lab_.

**This document will from now on call Innovation Lab: _Lab_**

## Definition

A _Lab_ is an event where people find solutions to problems defined within a scope or _theme_.

## Ingredients

### Theme

The theme sets the boundraries for what the lab should focus on, and can be both broad or narrow. The theme is there to help fuel creativity and productivity. A _free for all_ theme only deters these abilities.

The theme is very important, but can also be very abstract.

#### Examples

##### Example 1

Enrichment of financial data - Create a product or service which uses current gen systems and data and enriches it to provide value for our exisiting customers

#### Example 2

Symbiosis - Team up with new people to create a new product or service that could challenge the market or help our customers to do so.

_Note that these examples do not define what the team does creates in the lab. This is abstract. It can be a product video, a web site, an api or a product sheet (and so on). *All teams must present the result of their work at the end*. How it is presented is up to the team. See section [Presentation](link) for details_

### Venue

The venue is important and it is encouraged to choose a venue outside the common workspace, but sometimes it makes sense to have it _at home_.

### Competition

The lab's goal is to provide a creative space where people can thrive and focus on solving problems they are interested in. But there is always room for competition.

#### Jury

Each Lab can appoint a jury which will score the entries and announce a winning team.

#### Price

The price will vary from lab to lab, but I encourage the companies to pursue Proof of concept if that is within range i.e give the team some time to test their product.

## Format

### Welcome

The lab always starts with a welcoming of the participants. Make sure to have beverages available. If the lab starts first thing, have something to eat available.

Use this time to explain the rules of engagement (refer to this document). Be welcoming and ensure newcomers that this is not a coding challenge/event. This is an opportunity for everyone to contribute and learn something new.

Explain how the event is structured and answer questions from particpants.

Announce the key note and let people mingle.

_NOTE_: If held in office, advice participants not to return to work stations. This is not the time for fixing bugs or writing emails.

### Key note (optional, but recommended)

An inspirational presentation is always a good way of getting the creative juices to flow. ![ugh](https://media.giphy.com/media/pVAMI8QYM42n6/giphy.gif)

This is a good opportunity to invite external experts to speak about something related to the _theme_.
